RESEARCH DISCLAIMER:

This software is provided for research and educational purposes. The industry-specific 
residual emissions percentages and scenarios presented are illustrative examples based 
on literature review and are not definitive scientific conclusions. Users should not 
rely on these illustrative values for actual corporate climate planning or decision-making 
without conducting proper technical analysis and validation.

The purpose of this tool is to demonstrate the complexity and research gaps that necessitate 
systematic scientific investigation (Research Frontier 4) rather than to provide 
authoritative residual emissions thresholds.

For actual corporate climate strategy development, consult qualified experts and conduct 
industry-specific technical analysis appropriate to your specific operational context.
