# Dynamic Residual Emissions: Industry-Specific Analysis Tool

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://your-app-url-here.streamlit.app/)

## Overview

This interactive tool demonstrates why SBTi's static 11% residual emissions threshold fails for Scope 3-heavy industries and showcases the urgent need for **Research Frontier 4 (RF4): Industry-Specific Residual Emissions** research.

Built on real corporate disclosure data from CDP and scientific assessments from IPCC AR6, this analysis reveals how industries with 67-99% Scope 3 emissions face fundamentally different decarbonization constraints that uniform thresholds cannot address.

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ¯ **Problem Demonstration**
- **Static vs Dynamic Comparison**: Visual comparison of SBTi's uniform 11% threshold against industry-specific realities
- **Real Corporate Data**: Based on CDP analysis of 162-377 companies per industry
- **Scope 3 Focus**: Concentrates on industries where residual emissions are most critical

### ðŸ”¬ **Scientific Analysis**
- **RF2 Integration**: Builds on cross-sectoral complexity analysis
- **Technology Scenarios**: Conservative, ambitious, and breakthrough decarbonization pathways
- **Dynamic Modeling**: Time-dependent residual emissions evolution (2025-2050)

### ðŸ§ª **Interactive Tools**
- **Scenario Builder**: Explore "what-if" industry-specific maximum potentials
- **Financial Impact Calculator**: Quantify business implications of different approaches
- **Intervention Analysis**: Evaluate decarbonization lever potential and timelines

### ðŸ“Š **Industry Coverage**
- **Food, Beverage & Tobacco** (67% Scope 3): Agricultural biological constraints
- **Capital Goods** (90% Scope 3): Long-duration use-phase emissions
- **Consumer Goods** (85% Scope 3): Global supply chain complexity
- **Financial Services** (99% Scope 3): Portfolio diversification challenges
- **Retail** (95% Scope 3): Supplier dependency variations

## Research Foundation

## Key Insights Demonstrated

### ðŸš¨ **The Static Threshold Problem**
- All industries forced to use 11% residual threshold despite 67-99% Scope 3 variation
- Ignores fundamental differences in biological, technological, and economic constraints
- Creates perverse incentives for offset gaming rather than authentic decarbonization

### ðŸ”¬ **Industry-Specific Realities**
- **Food & Beverage**: Biological constraints suggest 15-25% residual emissions
- **Capital Goods**: Use-phase optimization could achieve 3-8% residuals
- **Financial Services**: Portfolio composition determines highly variable residuals
- **Consumer Goods**: Supply chain constraints indicate 15-22% residuals

### ðŸ’° **Business Impact**
- **Investment Misallocation**: Wrong balance between decarbonization vs. removals
- **Planning Uncertainty**: 3-15 percentage point error in residual assumptions
- **Financial Risk**: $100,000s in annual cost misestimation for large companies
- **Climate Integrity**: Premature offset reliance undermines net-zero credibility

## Disclaimer

**Important**: The industry-specific residual percentages shown are **illustrative scenarios** based on literature review and expert assessment. They demonstrate the complexity requiring systematic RF4 research rather than providing definitive thresholds. Actual residual emissions for any company require detailed technical analysis of their specific value chain and operational context.

This tool demonstrates **research necessity** rather than research conclusions. The goal is to showcase why RF4 systematic research is critical infrastructure for credible corporate climate action.
